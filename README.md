# Central Limit Theorem and Confidence Intervals

While we recommend using Python to find the answers to these questions, it is not required. You are more than welcome to use a calculator or pencil and paper to solve them, too.

# Quiz - Central Limit Theorem and Confidence Intervals

?: What is a sampling distribution?

( ) The distribution of data points within a single sample from a population.
(X) The probability distribution that shows every possible result a statistic can take.
( ) A distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

?: What is the correct way to interpret a 95% confidence interval for the population mean? 

( ) A 95% confidence interval is the interval that contains 95% of values in a sample.
(X) If we pull many samples and construct different confidence intervals for the population mean, we expect 95% of the intervals to contain the true population mean. 
( ) There is a 95% probability that the population mean lies between the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.
( ) A 95% confidence interval implies that 95% of all possible sample means fall within the range of the interval.
